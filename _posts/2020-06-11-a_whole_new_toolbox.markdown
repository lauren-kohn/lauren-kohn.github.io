To be frank, I am a coding neophyte. Although I learned a bit about HTML back in the dark ages (by which I mean high school), software development is a whole world that I have not yet explored.

For many years, I have enjoyed the opportunity to make parenting my primary career. A lot of this time has been spent learning whatever skills were needed and wearing all kinds of different hats. This flexibility has been a great fit for me because I love exploring new topics and ideas. Whether it is knitting or canning or microbiology (fascinating overlap between autoclaves and pressure canners), I appreciate the opportunity to dive into the nuances of how and why. 

To go a little further, the thrill of mastery – even at a basic level – provides a reliable source of motivation for me. It is particularly fulfilling when coupled with the creation of something useful. There is always *someone* who could use another warm and cozy knitted hat.

There are a lot of similarities to the position I previously held at a start-up healthcare technology company, where I learned numerous new skills to meet the company’s changing needs. From developing tangible marketing and product education supplies to managing corporate and individual consumer needs, I know the value of maintaining a diverse and evolving skill set. Whatever project I have in front of me, I am bringing my passion for learning and problem-solving.

It has been delightful to find that in pursuing full-stack development, I can merge my personal interests and professional advancement. I might not have tried coding without a bit of encouragement from my husband, an experienced Java programmer. Now that I have, though, I realize that becoming adept at full-stack development will mean that I have a whole new toolbox for meeting needs and solving problems. 

As I have started to explore JavaScript and Ruby, I can begin to see the parallels between coding and my collegiate and professional writing experience. There might be many ways to say the same thing, but some of them are much more concise and elegant than others. Understanding the vocabulary and the patterns involved really appeals to my detail-oriented nature, and I am looking forward to creating succinct and effective programs. I really feel like I am learning to “speak” these languages!

Already, the logic, versatility and potential for elegance in writing code have all sparked my interest. Best of all, I know that actual implementation of code-based solutions, put to work meeting real people’s needs, is going fan the flames.
